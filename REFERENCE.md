talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
[Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you
supply string values using the API.

  Here is an example on how to use this:

    oci_core_internet_gateway { 'tenant (root)/my_igw':
      ensure     => 'present',
      vcn        => 'my_compartment/my_own_vcn}',
      is_enabled => true,
    }

Default value: present

### oci_core_ip_sec_connection

A connection between a DRG and CPE. This connection consists of multiple IPSec
tunnels. Creating this connection is one of the steps required when setting up
an IPSec VPN.

**Important:**  Each tunnel in an IPSec connection can use either static routing or BGP dynamic
routing (see the {IPSecConnectionTunnel} object's
`routing` attribute). Originally only static routing was supported and
every IPSec connection was required to have at least one static route configured.
To maintain backward compatibility in the API when support for BPG dynamic routing was introduced,
the API accepts an empty list of static routes if you configure both of the IPSec tunnels to use
BGP dynamic routing. If you switch a tunnel's routing from `BGP` to `STATIC`, you must first
ensure that the IPSec connection is configured with at least one valid CIDR block static route.
Oracle uses the IPSec connection's static routes when routing a tunnel's traffic *only*
if that tunnel's `routing` attribute = `STATIC`. Otherwise the static routes are ignored.

For more information about the workflow for setting up an IPSec connection, see
[IPSec VPN](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPsec.htm).

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see

### oci_core_network_security_group

A *network security group* (NSG) provides virtual firewall rules for a specific set of
{Vnic} in a VCN. Compare NSGs with {SecurityList},
which provide virtual firewall rules to all the VNICs in a *subnet*.

A network security group consists of two items:

  * The set of {Vnic} that all have the same security rule needs (for
    example, a group of Compute instances all running the same application)
  * A set of NSG {SecurityRule} that apply to the VNICs in the group

After creating an NSG, you can add VNICs and security rules to it. For example, when you create
an instance, you can specify one or more NSGs to add the instance to (see
{#create_vnic_details create_vnic_details}). Or you can add an existing
instance to an NSG with {#update_vnic update_vnic}.

To add security rules to an NSG, see
{#add_network_security_group_security_rules add_network_security_group_security_rules}.

To list the VNICs in an NSG, see
{#list_network_security_group_vnics list_network_security_group_vnics}.

To list the security rules in an NSG, see
{#list_network_security_group_security_rules list_network_security_group_security_rules}.

For more information about network security groups, see
[Network Security Groups](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm).

**Important:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute service images automatically include firewall rules (for example,
Linux iptables, Windows firewall). If there are issues with some type of access to an instance,
make sure all of the following are set correctly:

  * Any security rules in any NSGs the instance's VNIC belongs to
  * Any {SecurityList} associated with the instance's subnet
  * The instance's OS firewall rules

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
[Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

### oci_core_security_list

A set of virtual firewall rules for your VCN. Security lists are configured at the subnet
level, but the rules are applied to the ingress and egress traffic for the individual instances
in the subnet. The rules can be stateful or stateless. For more information, see
[Security Lists](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm).
**Note:** Compare security lists to {NetworkSecurityGroup}s,
which let you apply a set of security rules to a *specific set of VNICs* instead of an entire
subnet. Oracle recommends using network security groups instead of security lists, although you
can use either or both together.

**Important:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute service images automatically include firewall rules (for example,
Linux iptables, Windows firewall). If there are issues with some type of access to an instance,
make sure both the security lists associated with the instance's subnet and the instance's
firewall rules are set correctly.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
[Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

### oci_core_service_gateway

Represents a router that lets your VCN privately access specific Oracle services such as Object
Storage without exposing the VCN to the public internet. Traffic leaving the VCN and destined
for a supported Oracle service (see {#list_services list_services}) is
routed through the service gateway and does not traverse the internet. The instances in the VCN
do not need to have public IP addresses nor be in a public subnet. The VCN does not need an internet gateway
for this traffic. For more information, see
[Access to Oracle Services: Service Gateway](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/servicegateway.htm).

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,

### oci_core_virtual_circuit

For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect.

A virtual circuit is an isolated network path that runs over one or more physical
network connections to provide a single, logical connection between the edge router
on the customer's existing network and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. *Private*
virtual circuits support private peering, and *public* virtual circuits support
public peering. For more information, see [FastConnect Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).

Each virtual circuit is made up of information shared between a customer, Oracle,
and a provider (if the customer is using FastConnect via a provider). Who fills in
a given property of a virtual circuit depends on whether the BGP session related to
that virtual circuit goes from the customer's edge router to Oracle, or from the provider's
edge router to Oracle. Also, in the case where the customer is using a provider, values
for some of the properties may not be present immediately, but may get filled in as the
provider and Oracle each do their part to provision the virtual circuit.

### oci_file_storage_export

A file system and the path that you can use to mount it. Each export
resource belongs to exactly one export set.

The export's path attribute is not a path in the
referenced file system, but the value used by clients for the path
component of the remotetarget argument when mounting the file
system.

The path must start with a slash (/) followed by a sequence of zero or more
slash-separated path elements. For any two export resources associated with
the same export set, except those in a 'DELETED' state, the path element
sequence for the first export resource can't contain the
complete path element sequence of the second export resource.


For example, the following are acceptable:

  * /example and /path
  * /example1 and /example2
  * /example and /example1

The following examples are not acceptable:
  * /example and /example/path
  * / and /example

Paths may not end in a slash (/). No path element can be a period (.)
or two periods in sequence (..). All path elements must be 255 bytes or less.

No two non-'DELETED' export resources in the same export set can
reference the same file system.

Use `exportOptions` to control access to an export. For more information, see
[Export Options](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/File/Tasks/exportoptions.htm).

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

### oci_identity_compartment

A collection of related resources. Compartments are a fundamental component of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
for organizing and isolating your cloud resources. You use them to clearly separate resources for the purposes
of measuring usage and billing, access (through the use of IAM Service policies), and isolation (separating the
resources for one project or business unit from another). A common approach is to create a compartment for each
major part of your organization. For more information, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm) and also
[Setting Up Your Tenancy](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/settinguptenancy.htm).

To place a resource in a compartment, simply specify the compartment ID in the \"Create\" request object when
initially creating the resource. For example, to launch an instance into a particular compartment, specify
that compartment's OCID in the `LaunchInstance` request. You can't move an existing resource from one
compartment to another.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values
using the API.

  Here is an example on how to use this:

    oci_identity_compartment { 'tenant (root)/my_compartment':
      ensure          => 'present',
      description     => 'my own compartment',
    }

  This documentation is generated from the [Ruby OCI SDK](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ruby-sdk).

#### Properties

The following properties are available in the `oci_identity_compartment` type.

##### `ensure`

Valid values: present, absent

The basic property that the resource should be in.

Default value: present

### oci_identity_dynamic_group

A dynamic group defines a matching rule. Every bare metal or virtual machine instance is deployed with an instance certificate.
The certificate contains metadata about the instance. This includes the instance OCID and the compartment OCID, along
with a few other optional properties. When an API call is made using this instance certificate as the authenticator,
the certificate can be matched to one or multiple dynamic groups. The instance can then get access to the API
based on the permissions granted in policies written for the dynamic groups.

This works like regular user/group membership. But in that case, the membership is a static relationship, whereas
in a dynamic group, the membership of an instance certificate to a dynamic group is determined during runtime.
For more information, see [Managing Dynamic Groups](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingdynamicgroups.htm).

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using
the API.

  Here is an example on how to use this:

    oci_identity_dynamic_group { 'tenant (root)/my_dynamic_group':
        ensure        => 'present',
        description   => 'description',
        matching_rule => "any {ANY {instance.id = 'ocid1.instance.region1.sea.abzwkljrobrgevdin34ftbzurf6vqutavtfqadaa2xlj3e66qwudvljkffxa'}}",
      }

  This documentation is generated from the [Ruby OCI SDK](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ruby-sdk).

#### Properties

##### `ensure`

Valid values: present, absent

The basic property that the resource should be in.

Default value: present

### oci_identity_group

A collection of users who all need the same type of access to a particular set of resources or compartment.
For conceptual information about groups and other IAM Service components, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).

If you're federating with an identity provider (IdP), you need to create mappings between the groups
defined in the IdP and groups you define in the IAM service. For more information, see
[Identity Providers and Federation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm). Also see
{IdentityProvider} and
{IdpGroupMapping}.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values
using the API.

  Here is an example on how to use this:

### oci_identity_identity_provider

The resulting base object when you add an identity provider to your tenancy. A
{Saml2IdentityProvider}
is a specific type of `IdentityProvider` that supports the SAML 2.0 protocol. Each
`IdentityProvider` object has its own OCID. For more information, see
[Identity Providers and Federation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm).

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string
values using the API.

This class has direct subclasses. If you are using this class as input to a service operations then you should favor using a subclass over the base class

  Here is an example on how to use this:

    oci_identity_provider { 'tenant (root)/my_provider':
      ensure          => 'present',
      description     => 'my own provider',
    }

[Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

The word \"policy\" is used by people in different ways:

  * An individual statement written in the policy language
  * A collection of statements in a single, named \"policy\" document (which has an Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) assigned to it)
  * The overall body of policies your organization uses to control access to resources

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
talk to an administrator.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values
using the API.

  Here is an example on how to use this:

    oci_identity_policy { 'tenant (root)/my_policy}':
        ensure        => 'present',
        description   => 'My own policy',
        statements    => ['Allow group Administrators to manage all-resources in compartment my_compartment'],
      }

### oci_identity_user

An individual employee or system that needs to manage or use your company's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
resources. Users might need to launch instances, manage remote disks, work with your cloud network, etc. Users
have one or more IAM Service credentials ({ApiKey},
{UIPassword}, {SwiftPassword} and
{AuthToken}).
For more information, see [User Credentials](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/usercredentials.htm)). End users of your
application are not typically IAM Service users. For conceptual information about users and other IAM Service
components, see [Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).

These users are created directly within the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure system, via the IAM service.
They are different from *federated users*, who authenticate themselves to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
Console via an identity provider. For more information, see
[Identity Providers and Federation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm).

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
