  List of the OCIDs of the {Service} objects to
enable for the service gateway. This list can be empty if you don't want to enable any
`Service` objects when you create the gateway. You can enable a `Service`
object later by using either {#attach_service_id attach_service_id}
or {#update_service_gateway update_service_gateway}.

For each enabled `Service`, make sure there's a route rule with the `Service` object's `cidrBlock`
as the rule's destination and the service gateway as the rule's target. See
{RouteTable}.
