  Custom metadata key/value pairs that you provide, such as the SSH public key
required to connect to the instance.

A metadata service runs on every launched instance. The service is an HTTP
endpoint listening on 169.254.169.254. You can use the service to:

* Provide information to [Cloud-Init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
  to be used for various system initialization tasks.

* Get information about the instance, including the custom metadata that you
  provide when you launch the instance.

 **Providing Cloud-Init Metadata**

 You can use the following metadata key names to provide information to
 Cloud-Init:

 **"ssh_authorized_keys"** - Provide one or more public SSH keys to be
 included in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the default user on the
 instance. Use a newline character to separate multiple keys. The SSH
 keys must be in the format necessary for the `authorized_keys` file, as shown
 in the example below.

 **"user_data"** - Provide your own base64-encoded data to be used by
 Cloud-Init to run custom scripts or provide custom Cloud-Init configuration. For
 information about how to take advantage of user data, see the
 [Cloud-Init Documentation](http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/format.html).

 **Note:** Cloud-Init does not pull this data from the `http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/metadata/`
 path. When the instance launches and either of these keys are provided, the key values are formatted as
 OpenStack metadata and copied to the following locations, which are recognized by Cloud-Init:

 `http://169.254.169.254/openstack/latest/meta_data.json` - This JSON blob
 contains, among other things, the SSH keys that you provided for
  **"ssh_authorized_keys"**.

 `http://169.254.169.254/openstack/latest/user_data` - Contains the
 base64-decoded data that you provided for **"user_data"**.

         "quake_bot_level" : "Severe",
         "ssh_authorized_keys" : "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQCZ06fccNTQfq+xubFlJ5ZR3kt+uzspdH9tXL+lAejSM1NXM+CFZev7MIxfEjas06y80ZBZ7DUTQO0GxJPeD8NCOb1VorF8M4xuLwrmzRtkoZzU16umt4y1W0Q4ifdp3IiiU0U8/WxczSXcUVZOLqkz5dc6oMHdMVpkimietWzGZ4LBBsH/LjEVY7E0V+a0sNchlVDIZcm7ErReBLcdTGDq0uLBiuChyl6RUkX1PNhusquTGwK7zc8OBXkRuubn5UKXhI3Ul9Nyk4XESkVWIGNKmw8mSpoJSjR8P9ZjRmcZVo8S+x4KVPMZKQEor== ryan.smith@company.com

      }
 **Getting Metadata on the Instance**

 To get information about your instance, connect to the instance using SSH and issue any of the
 following GET requests:

     curl http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/
     curl http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/metadata/
     curl http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/metadata/<any-key-name>

 You'll get back a response that includes all the instance information; only the metadata information; or
 the metadata information for the specified key name, respectively.
